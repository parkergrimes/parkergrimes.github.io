I recently finished reading [Seth Godin's][seth-godin] book [Linchpin][linchpin-amazon]. It inspired me to just start shipping stuff. Stuff in this case is my own personal website and blog. I've attempted blogging a few times. Each time I've failed. Well, I take that back. I did actually ship content. I did a 365 photography project in 2009. I took a photo every day for a year and wrote a small post for every day. That blog is no longer around. It became a casualty when I got rid of an old shared web host plan that I had for a very long time. Instead of taking the time to export the data, I just axed it. A casualty of my impatience.

I also used to have a blog for my photography. The posts were lame. That blog was just a platform to show of the latest photoshoots that I had been on. I never had anything useful to say. That blog too was a casualty of my impatience. I tend to cut things loose and move on. In all reality, this blog will probably have the same fate.

However, I hope it doesn't. The reason I think this blog might stick around is because of the platform I've chosen. I'm sick of content management systems. I'm also sick of having my data held hostage by a platform or service. This time around, I've chosen to just build a static website using [Jekyll][jekyllrb], host it on [GitHub pages][github], and write in [Markdown][daringfireball]. Future proofing is what I call this approach.

The nature of this blog is up in the air at this point. It will probably be technical in nature. My audience base at this point is zero, but I have to start somewhere.
